Assignment 1 notes:
Might be the way I downloaded the test file, but for some reason there is a really weird char at the end of each line? 
If this is not an issue with other peoples file, the line where command = command[:-2] should just be [:-1]

Left the files as proof its working, to remove and work from scratch: `rm -r db*`
Also can take out printing, but kinda wanted to see the commands
Also dont judge, thought it would be a lot smaller. Might need to split it off from a script to a real program with a main
