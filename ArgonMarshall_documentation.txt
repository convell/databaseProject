ORGANIZATION:
We use folders as "databases" and files within them as "tables." Data is written to the files via creation and alteration. If table "x" is created in database "one," the file path will be "somepath/one/x"

IMPLEMENTATION:
The program uses a series of "if" and "elif" statements in the main to decide how to handle the command. It does a string compare for the input and calls on the corresponding function to handle the request.

It does some basic error checking to ensure a database is actually selected when trying to select a table or use the database, the paths exist before trying to modify something in them, and exiting the program elegantly.

If a command is not entered properly, it will omit that command and allow you to continue entering commands rather than terminating. A proper command must have a ";" to terminate it, unless it's a comment.

The script normalizes input by setting each command to uppercase when deciding which statement to enter to allow for flexibility with entering commands. For example, "insert into" and "INSERT INTO" both work.

LIBRARIES:
The script imports "OS" for modifying files within different selected paths. In addition, it imports "RE" to handle the case-insensitive nature of SQL.

EXECUTION:
Type "python CrupiHammons_proj2.py" into a Linux terminal, assuming Python is installed on the machine running the script.
