DATABASES - CS 457 - PA 1 - DESIGN DOCUMENTATION

Our design organizes databases through the use of folders, while organizing tables in their own files. As an examble Database db_1 with table tb_1 would look like the following:
<CWD>/db_1/tb_1

Where tb_1 would be a text file with the data stored inside of it

Overall the program can be described as a barebones python script with minimal imports (only OS and SYS). It uses raw_input to get commands from std_id allowing it to read files.
It then takes the command and strips the semicolon terminator as we assume all commands are terminated properly.
From there it will check the key commands to see if they are in the command string, and if they are it will execute the logic to either read, write, or create a database/table
This all is in a try catch that catches the exception EOF for the CNTL d terminator and EOF for std_in arguments. A while true runs inside the try catch till EOF is reached, CNTL D
or .EXIT is called.
